# Documentation with GitHub Copilot

## Generating Documentation with GitHub Copilot

### In mathematics, a Diophantine equation is an equation, typically a polynomial equation in two or more unknowns with integer coefficients, for which only integer solutions are of interest. A linear Diophantine equation equates to a constant the sum of two or more monomials, each of degree one. Some diophantine equations are difficult to solve, while others are much easier

`diophantine_equation.py` contains code that attempts to solve the diphantine_equation. Use this file to demonstrate the capabilities of GitHub Copilot to explain code and create documentation for an existing program

### Task 1

1. Open `diophantine_equation.py` in your VS Code window

### Task 2

2. Open the GitHub Copilot Chat extension and chain prompts with the following prompts: 

  a. Use the /explain command to explain the code --> `/explain the code in diophantine_equation.py`
  
  b. Ask GitHub Copilot to answer questions about documentation --> `What are the best practices for markdown documentation?`
  
  c. Create documentation for the diophantine_equation Python program --> `Generate documentation for diophantine_equation.py`
  
  d. Reprompt GitHub Copilot Chat to add in any missing pieces that were mentioned in 2b

  2a. Read through the explanation and see if it matches the explanation of a diophantine equation [here](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/DiophantineEquation.html)
  
  2b. Take note of the best practices for documentation for future comparison
  
  2c. Add the documentation into a new file named `diophantine_documentation.md`
  
  2d. Add the improved documentation into `diophantine_documentation.md`

### Task 3

3. Save the new files and commit your changes 

    #### Using the VS Code Interface

    1. Click the VS Code **Source Control** tab on the left hand of your VS Code screen or press `Ctrl + Shift + G` 
    2. Stage your changes by clicking the small plus icon in the righthand corner of the panel
    3. Enter a commit message and select the **Commit** button
    4. Once changes are staged, click the elipses in the far right corner, choose **Push** and enter your password
    5. Wait approx. 1 minute and refresh your GitHub repository to ensure that the changes are reflected in your repository

## Generate Documentation with GitHub Copilot - Your Turn!

### Task 1
1. Take some time to write your own program, or copy over a file that you have been working on in your personal time
2. Save the file, and keep it open in your workspace

### Task 2

3. Prompt GitHub Copilot Chat to explain the program and generate documentation for the file
4. Add the generated documentation into a new file named `my_documentation.md`
5. Prompt GitHub Copilot to make corrections as needed

### Task 3

6. Save the new files and commit your changes
