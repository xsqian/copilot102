# Translation with GitHub Copilot

## One of the ways that GitHub Copilot Chat can act as our research assistant is through using its incredible translation features. Use GitHub Copilot Chat to translate files into other languages, or alternatively explain the similarities/differences between programming languages

### Task 1

1. Open GitHub Copilot Chat and use it to research the differences between C# and Python with the prompt: 

```
Provide 5 bullet points for the similarities and differences between C# and Python
```

2. Visualize the differences between the languages by prompting GitHub Copilot Chat to create `hello_world` functions for each:

```
Create hello_world() functions in C# and Python. Detail the differences between each.
```

### Task 2

3. Open `SIR.cs` and translate it into the Python programming language:


  3a. Copy all of the code in `SIR.cs` and paste into Copilot Chat

  3b. Prompt Copilot Chat to translate the above C# code into Python code

  3c. Add the newly translated code into a new file named `SIR.py`

### Task 3

4. Save your changes and commit your code

    #### Using the VS Code Interface

    1. Click the VS Code **Source Control** tab on the left hand of your VS Code screen or press `Ctrl + Shift + G` 
    2. Stage your changes by clicking the small plus icon in the righthand corner of the panel
    3. Enter a commit message and select the **Commit** button
    4. Once changes are staged, click the elipses in the far right corner, choose **Push** and enter your password
    5. Wait approx. 1 minute and refresh your GitHub repository to ensure that the changes are reflected in your repository
